# Services

Every project is unique and requires specific workflows. Please contact the core if there are specific workflows or analysis (not listed) that you have in mind. 

The bioinformatics core have expertise in the area of:

**Genomics and Transcriptomics**

- RNA-seq
- small RNA-seq, microRNA-seq
- Ribo-seq

**Epigenomics**

- ChIP-seq (Transcription factors, histones)
- Methyl-seq, BS-seq
- ATAC-seq

The core also have experiences with:

- Variant-seq
- Metagenomics (16S, ITS, metagenomes)

Workflows currently being developed:

- single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC-seq
- long read transcriptomes (PacBio, ONT)

The core have experiences working with model and non-model organisms including:
