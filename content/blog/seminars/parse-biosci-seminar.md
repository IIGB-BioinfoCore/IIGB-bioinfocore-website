**UCR Institute for Integrative Genome Biology** hosts a seminar by Parse Biosciences titled "Single Cell 3.0 - The Next Evolution of Single Cell Genomics".

Scalable single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) up to 1 MILLION cells is readily available with the Evercode technology. The core of this approach, split-pool combinatorial barcoding, was originally demonstrated in a [2018 Science paper with SPLiT-seq](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aam8999) and substantially improved for wide-scale adoption.  

Our speakers will describe the Evercode technology, its implication on single-cell experiments, and the drastic improvements achieved since the original publication.
