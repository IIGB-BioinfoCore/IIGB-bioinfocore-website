      <description>UCR published an article by Jules Bernstein on April 6, 2022 titled &amp;ldquo;UCR Genomics Core assists state with COVID variant tracking.&amp;rdquo;
The article highlights work by the IIGB Genomics and Bioinformatics Cores in sequencing and processing COVID-19 samples at UC Riverside in collaboration with the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) to help prepare the state for potential surges by new variants of the disease.

      <description>UCR Institute for Integrative Genome Biology hosts a seminar by Parse Biosciences titled &amp;ldquo;Single Cell 3.0 - The Next Evolution of Single Cell Genomics&amp;rdquo;.
Scalable single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) up to 1 MILLION cells is readily available with the Evercode technology. The core of this approach, split-pool combinatorial barcoding, was originally demonstrated in a 2018 Science paper with SPLiT-seq and substantially improved for wide-scale adoption.
Our speakers will describe the Evercode technology, its implication on single-cell experiments, and the drastic improvements achieved since the original publication.</description>

      <description>Core Mission Welcome to the Bioinformatics Core Facility at UC Riverside. Our facility is part of the Institute for Integrative Genome Biology (IIGB) that operates a modern biotechnology hub consisting of core facilities for genomics, bioinformatics, proteomics, and metabolomics. The bioinformatics facility provides convenient access to the NGS data sequenced at UCR, data analysis, and programming expertise. The resources serve scientists at UC Riverside to master the informatics needs of their research in a proficient and cost-effective manner.</description>
