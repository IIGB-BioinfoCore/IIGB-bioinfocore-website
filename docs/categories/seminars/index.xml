      <description>Info An informational hybrid in-person/webinar on a single cell core grant program hosted by the IIGB Genomics and Bioinformatics Cores, Parse Biosciences, and Illumina.
The session provides information on the split-pool combinatorial barcoding technology developed at Parse Biosciences and a grant program involving the IIGB cores, Parse Biosciences, and Illumina. Here short talks by:
 Wei Zhang (Genomics Coordinator) Brandon Le (Bioinformatics Coordinator) Bo Liu (Executive Sales Specialist, Illumina) John Walsh (VP Marketing, Parse Biosciences) Samantha O&amp;rsquo;Neill (Technical Sales Manager, Parse Biosciences)  Come learn more about how to apply for the award.</description>

      <description>UCR Institute for Integrative Genome Biology hosts a seminar by Parse Biosciences titled &amp;ldquo;Single Cell 3.0 - The Next Evolution of Single Cell Genomics&amp;rdquo;.
Scalable single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) up to 1 MILLION cells is readily available with the Evercode technology. The core of this approach, split-pool combinatorial barcoding, was originally demonstrated in a 2018 Science paper with SPLiT-seq and substantially improved for wide-scale adoption.
Our speakers will describe the Evercode technology, its implication on single-cell experiments, and the drastic improvements achieved since the original publication.</description>
