# Core Mission

Welcome to the Bioinformatics Core Facility at UC Riverside. Our facility is part of the Institute for Integrative Genome Biology (IIGB) that operates a modern biotechnology hub consisting of core facilities for genomics, bioinformatics, proteomics, and metabolomics.

<br>

The bioinformatics facility provides convenient access to the NGS data sequenced at UCR, data analysis, and programming expertise. The resources serve scientists at UC Riverside to master the informatics needs of their research in a proficient and cost-effective manner. With over twenty years of data analysis experiences, the core can assist with your bioinformatics need to advance your research.

>The Bioinformatics Core goals are to 
>- provide exceptional service in reproducible computational data analysis
>- educate the research community on current bioinformatics tools and techniques, 
>- foster long-term collaborations with the UCR research community and 
>- connect bioinformaticians on campus to promote the exchange of ideas and expertise. 

The Core provides project-specific consultation on experimental design and data analysis, development of novel analysis pipelines and workflow with special skills in the areas of genomics (e.g., Whole Genome- and Exome-seq), transcriptomics (e.g., RNA-seq, small RNA-seq, Ribo-seq), epigenomics (e.g., Methyl-seq, ATAC-seq), and system biology. 

To foster collaborations and educate researchers on analysis tools and techniques, the Core also provides hands-on bioinformatics training workshops and seminars to undergraduate and graduate students, post-docs, research scientists, and investigators. To promote the exchange of expertise and ideas in bioinformatics, the Core will host meet-ups/zoom sessions for specific methods and topics lead by novice and expert bioinformaticians. 

>The fundamental goal of the Core is to provide first-rate computational analysis, pipelines, and workflows that will free the UCR investigators and research community to explore novel and exciting biological questions.
