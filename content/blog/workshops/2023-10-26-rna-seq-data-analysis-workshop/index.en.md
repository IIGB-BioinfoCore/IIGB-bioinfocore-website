### Requirements

Attendees should have a laptop (Mac or PC) to follow along in the workshop. If you don't have a laptop, you can check one out at the [Tomas Rivera](https://library.ucr.edu/libraries/tomas-rivera-library) or [Orbach Science](https://library.ucr.edu/libraries/orbach-science-library) Library. Go to the library circulation desk for more information.

**Mac Users:** The MacOS have a built-in terminal program for the command line interface and requires no additional software installation.

**PC Users:** The WinOS does not automatically come with a terminal/shell system pre-installed. For Windows 10 and 11 users, you can install MobaXterm [link](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net) which provides all the remote network tools needed.
