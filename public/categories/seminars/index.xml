      <description>UCR Institute for Integrative Genome Biology hosts a seminar by Parse Biosciences titled &amp;ldquo;Single Cell 3.0 - The Next Evolution of Single Cell Genomics&amp;rdquo;.
Scalable single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) up to 1 MILLION cells is readily available with the Evercode technology. The core of this approach, split-pool combinatorial barcoding, was originally demonstrated in a 2018 Science paper with SPLiT-seq and substantially improved for wide-scale adoption.
Our speakers will describe the Evercode technology, its implication on single-cell experiments, and the drastic improvements achieved since the original publication.</description>
