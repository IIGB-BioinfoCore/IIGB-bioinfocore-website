      <description>UCR published an article by Jules Bernstein on April 6, 2022 titled &amp;ldquo;UCR Genomics Core assists state with COVID variant tracking.&amp;rdquo;
The article highlights work by the IIGB Genomics and Bioinformatics Cores in sequencing and processing COVID-19 samples at UC Riverside in collaboration with the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) to help prepare the state for potential surges by new variants of the disease.

      <description>UCR Institute for Integrative Genome Biology hosts a seminar by Parse Biosciences titled &amp;ldquo;Single Cell 3.0 - The Next Evolution of Single Cell Genomics&amp;rdquo;.
Scalable single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) up to 1 MILLION cells is readily available with the Evercode technology. The core of this approach, split-pool combinatorial barcoding, was originally demonstrated in a 2018 Science paper with SPLiT-seq and substantially improved for wide-scale adoption.
Our speakers will describe the Evercode technology, its implication on single-cell experiments, and the drastic improvements achieved since the original publication.</description>
